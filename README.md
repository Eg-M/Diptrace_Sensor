# PCB designs

- 1. Nanowire resistance measurement circuit: Electrical board to simultaneous measurement of resistance from two nanowires. I simulated a circuit for nanowires, designed the schematic and a PCB board. Furthermore, it is planned to write code for the Arduino board to transmit data to the PC.
- 2. Development of the data acquisition system for sensing food spoilage:
	- 2.1. It was simulated the equivalent circuit of the paper gas sensor (MATLAB);
	- 2.2. It was designed the electrical boards which can process signals from multiple paper sensors, humidity/temperature sensors to control environmental conditions during the experiment;
	- 2.3. It was constructed the prototype of the board which can process the signal and power the sensor, using standard communication protocol NFC
Diptrace files for PEGS sensor, Temperature, and Humid sensors.
Here are the collections of the files related to the development of Data Acquisition system for food spoilage and Nanowires Ohmmeter reading circuit.

* dip files are DipTrace PCB layouts files
* sch files are DipTrace Schematic files
* brd files are Eagle board files
